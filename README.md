## Overview
This project allows you to search for Github profiles using their usernames. It fetches and displays the user's profile information including their avatar, name, bio, followers, following, and public repositories.

## How to Use

2. Click the 'Search' button.
3. The profile information of the entered Github username will be displayed on the page.

## Code Structure

### HTML
